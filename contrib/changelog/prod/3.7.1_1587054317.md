* Removed gawk dependency, which was needed for autocompletion to work on older systems. Now autocompletion should work just fine without it.
* We made dockerizing the app easier to give you more flexibility.
* Added more information to logs so we can troubleshoot more effectively.
* Fixed: Now the app handles your manually whitelisted destinations better.
