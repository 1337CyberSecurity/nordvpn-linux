* New: We want you to get the best experience using the latest version of NordVPN. That’s why we’ve implemented a version checker. Now, we will notify you when it’s time to update – just to make sure you’re not missing out on any of our features by using an older app version.
* Fixed: The quick-connect command selects the best server for you. However, sometimes it would pick one of our specialty servers. We understand you might not want one. So now it’s only our regular servers you can be quick-connected to.
* Fixed: When auto-connecting to VPN on startup, our app had a hard time handling your whitelisted ports. Now everything works as intended.
