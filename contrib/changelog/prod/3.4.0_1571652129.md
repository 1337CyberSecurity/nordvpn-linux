* We made it easier for you to try NordLynx – the solution for a fast, secure, and private VPN connection. To start using NordLynx, you no longer have to download the WireGuard® package. Use the command ‘nordvpn set technology nordlynx’ – and that’s it!
* The ‘nordvpn settings’ command shows the VPN technology you’re currently using: OpenVPN or NordLynx.
* Here’s a little time-saver: when you’re connected to VPN and want to switch to another server or location, you can do it without disconnecting first.
* When connecting to group servers, you can specify the location, for example, ‘nordvpn connect --group p2p Canada’.
* Oh, and we almost forgot – a bunch of various fixes and improvements to make the app run smoother.
