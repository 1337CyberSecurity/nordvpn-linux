* Fixed: Some users had an issue with the app freezing at random. Rumor has it, some were even confronted with the never-ending spinner. The bug causing the trouble is fixed now, and the app is set to run smoothly without awkward silent interruptions.
* Better: When opened, the app will now greet you with a list of useful commands displayed in the terminal.
