* Now the NordVPN app supports older Linux distributions.
* Added a manual page where you can find the list of commands, examples, and more.
* The ‘nordvpn status’ got leveled up! It now shows country and region (if applicable) you’re connected to, as well as the connection time.
* Fixed a double-faced bug, which prevented disconnecting from VPN properly, or caused the app to crash when running the ‘nordvpn status’ command.
