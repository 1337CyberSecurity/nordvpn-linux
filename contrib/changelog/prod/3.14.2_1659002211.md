* New feature: Meshnet! From now on, you only need the NordVPN app with Meshnet enabled to connect to remote devices securely. Link up to 10 of your own devices and 50 devices of other NordVPN users. Meshnet is great for accessing and sharing files, playing multiplayer games, or getting some work done on shared projects! Use the `nordvpn set meshnet on` command to turn it on. To find all Meshnet-related commands and get help, type `nordvpn meshnet`.
* Fixed: The app wasn't following specific commands when connected to the VPN or kept ignoring your notification preferences when using `nordvpn set notify`. Order has been restored.
* Fixed: Sometimes the app failed to set a DNS address properly, resulting in it not being able to connect you to VPN. That shouldn't be the case anymore.
* Fixed: Connecting to the VPN while having Kill Switch on is no longer a challenge for the app.
