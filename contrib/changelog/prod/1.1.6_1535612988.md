* Do you know the Internet-famous cute little penguin that slides on his tummy down the hill? We strive to make our user experience just like that – exciting and smooth. With a few new notes for guidance and more detailed help commands, we believe we’re getting there.
* We added extra powers to the ‘nordvpn status’ command, so now it shows the connection status, the server you’re connected to, your new IP address and the Internet protocol in use (TCP or UDP).
* Improved compatibility with older OpenVPN versions. NordVPN works with the OpenVPN version 2.3.0 and later.
* For the sake of effective troubleshooting, we fine-tuned the app activity logging to make it more detail.
* Did some behind the scenes tinkering for a better app experience. And by saying ‘better’, we mean ‘bug-free’.
