* Now you can select the way the app handles Internet connection hiccups.
* We added a possibility to whitelist specific ports to make certain services work even after the Kill Switch kicks in.

For example, it doesn’t matter anymore whether you type ‘nordvpn connect Germany’, or ‘nordvpn connect germany’ – now we get the idea both ways.
