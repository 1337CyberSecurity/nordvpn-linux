* We’re introducing NordLynx – the solution for a fast, secure, and private VPN connection. Our NordLynx technology is based on WireGuard® and lets you experience its speed benefits without compromising your privacy.

    By default, NordVPN for Linux runs on the OpenVPN protocol. After you download the latest version, follow these steps to switch to NordLynx:

    1. Install WireGuard. Tutorials for different distributions are available in our Help Center: https://support.nordvpn.com/1362931332/
    2. Open the terminal and enter ‘nordvpn set technology NordLynx’.
    3. Enter ‘nordvpn c’ to connect to VPN.

    That’s it – now your app is running on NordLynx. You can always switch back to OpenVPN by entering ‘nordvpn set technology OpenVPN’.

* Now you can give us instant feedback about your connection speeds. Was it like driving an F1 racer? Or rather a slow and bumpy ride? We want to know. Your feedback will help us improve!

* A few sneaky bugs that managed to slip into the previous release are gone now.
