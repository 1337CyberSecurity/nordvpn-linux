* Our app for Linux joins the rest of NordVPN apps with the login flow via Nord Account. It's the platform that unifies all Nord services and eliminates the need for multiple accounts and passwords. It also lets you add an extra layer of security to your account with multi-factor authentication.

To log in with Nord Account, use the command `nordvpn login --nordaccount`. Weâ€™ll take you to your browser for login and then bring you back to the app. Smooth.

You can still log in with the `nordvpn login` command, so choose the way which works better for you.

* A few performance and security improvements are in place.
