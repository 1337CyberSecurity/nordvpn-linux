* New in Meshnet: When routing traffic through a linked computer, you’ll have access to its local network devices instead of yours – if the linked computer has granted this permission to you. And the other way around: you can allow or block access to your local network for each device that's routing traffic through your computer. Use the `nordvpn mesh peer local` command to control this permission.
* You can now log in by using a token generated in your Nord Account. See `--token` option in `nordvpn login --help`.
* Added the `routing` setting. See `nordvpn set routing --help`.
* Added the `fwmark` setting. See `nordvpn set fwmark --help`.
* Fixed: The app version is now displayed properly in the manual page.
* Fixed: The app no longer gets stuck in the `connecting` state when you're offline and the set protocol is OpenVPN.
* Fixed: Meshnet now works on PureOS.
* Minor fixes in Meshnet.
