* In the previous release, we introduced NordLynx – a solution for a fast and secure VPN connection based on WireGuard®. Now we’re bringing a few improvements to make your NordLynx experience even better:

    1. The CyberSec feature now plays nicely with NordLynx. You can still block ads and shield yourself from malware after switching from OpenVPN.
    2. Auto-connect now works smoothly. We fixed the bug where the app was trying to connect to VPN way too soon – even before your computer connected to the internet.

* Also, we’ve added subtle tweaks and squished a few minor bugs to make NordVPN work better for you.
