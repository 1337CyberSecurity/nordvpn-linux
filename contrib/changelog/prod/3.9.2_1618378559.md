* Improved application logs handling: Instead of a file, which sometimes may take up more space than desired, logs are now provided as standard output to give you more control.
* Fixed: There was a bug of a rare kind that would make every single connection fail, and only a system restart could stop this vicious cycle. The bug is no more.
