* The NordVPN 2.0.0 is here – all better from the ground up!
* The server picker algo-rhythm is a dancer with smart moves and new grooves. The algorithm is lightweight and extra smart now, so it selects the best server for you with even higher accuracy.
* With this version, we say ‘yes’ to custom DNS. You can set your preferred DNS server manually by using ‘nordvpn set dns’.
* The list of countries is now displayed neatly.
* You can see a list of cities where servers are located in a specific country.
* Poker face no more – we’re introducing loader, that is, a spinning indicator showing that your command is running.
* Did some fine-tuning for the auto-connect. When it’s set, the app launches on startup and connects to VPN. If internet network errors occur, the app attempts to reconnect to VPN automatically.
* Fixed: sometimes, the ‘nordvpn status’ has been failing to indicate the current server correctly, especially after changing a few of them quickly. Now, the status is shown real-time, indeed.
* Fixed: putting a computer to sleep has been causing the app to quit, but not anymore: NordVPN continues to run and restarts VPN connection after a computer wakes up.
